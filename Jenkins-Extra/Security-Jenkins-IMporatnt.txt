>  Use workspace cleanup plugin to cleanup the workspace as post build step.
> Alternative1 - provision a new slave per job
> Alternative2 - run the build inside a container. Everything will be discarded once the build is finished
> Delete old build or other large size folder
> You can go to Manage Nodes --> configure main node -->disk space
> a cleanup job with the following build steps. You can schedule it @daily or @weekly.

Execute system groovy script build step to clean up old jobs:
    import jenkins.model.Jenkins
    import hudson.model.Job

    BUILDS_TO_KEEP = 5

    for (job in Jenkins.instance.items) {
      println job.name

      def recent = job.builds.limit(BUILDS_TO_KEEP)

      for (build in job.builds) {
        if (!recent.contains(build)) {
          println "Preparing to delete: " + build
          build.delete()
        }
      }
    }
You'd need to have Groovy plugin installed.

Execute shell build step to clean cache directories
rm -r ~/.gradle/
rm -r ~/.m2/

echo "Disk space"
du -h -s /

> the disk space is generally cheap these days. masters can have hundreds of GB to avoid disk space issue.
